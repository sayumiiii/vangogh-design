    <p>Around the world, people recognise this man with a red beard and an earnest look in his eyes. Vincent van Gogh painted about 35 self-portraits in total, most of them in Paris. For him, this was a way of practising portrait painting. His intention was not to portray himself as realistically as possible. He used the Neo-Impressionist style here, with short, rough brushstrokes. These alternate with longer strokes, such as the orange in his beard.</p>

    <p>You can almost feel the dryness and heat in this painting of the flat landscape around Arles in the south of France. Van Gogh combined the azure blue of the sky with yellow and green tones for the land to capture the atmosphere of a summer’s day. He worked in the wheatfields for days at a time under the burning sun. This was an immensely productive period, in which he completed ten paintings and five drawings in just over a week, until a heavy storm brought the harvest season to an end.</p>

    <p>This simple still life of a pot of chives has a decorative pattern in the background. It is unclear exactly what Van Gogh was painting – maybe wallpaper or part of an Oriental carpet. The symmetry of the composition is broken by the chive stems on the right, next to the pot.
        Ordinary chives have round, hollow leaves; these garlic chives have flat ones with pointed ends.</p>

    <p>When Van Gogh made this painting he started with the flowers and butterflies and filled in the blue background only afterwards. This is clear from the fact that the broad strokes of blue paint occasionally cover the green stems of the flowers. Van Gogh even left part of the canvas unpainted, with the bare cloth visible.</p>
